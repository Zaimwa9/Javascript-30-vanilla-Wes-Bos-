    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    console.log(players, team);
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    
    const team2 = players.slice(); // Without argument it creates a copy
    
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // Best ways
    
    const team5 = Array.from(players); // Best ways
   
   
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
    name: 'Wes Bos',
    age: 80
};

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;  // still reference 
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99}); // Copy and no reference
    console.log(cap2); 
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person};
    //console.log(cap3 + ' object spread')
    
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'  // Modify the reference ! Object.assign only goes one level deep

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); // Goes several level deep
    // Json stringify turns into a string before being right away parsed back as an object without references at all
