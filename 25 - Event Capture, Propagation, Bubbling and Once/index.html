    document.body.addEventListener('click', logText) // Same as below because the divs are nested inside the body

    divs.forEach(div => div.addEventListener('click', logText, {
        capture: true
        // ,once: true   // Once makes the event trigger only ONCE until next refresh ! no matter what
        }))  // Clicking on the 3rd child we receive a log for each parent (three, two, one) because it is wrapped inside the two others
    // That is called "bubbling"
    // The browser will first do a capture that follows a top to bottom flow. When we clicked on "three" the browser dived into three:
    // It goes this click was on bod => one => two => three and not the other way around
    // At this stage the event is not fired yet, it just "captures" where the click was and stored it.
    // Then it bubbled the event and fires it the other way around: three => two => one => bod

    // The object "capture: true" is a third parameter to fire the event along the capture
