# Javascript-30-vanilla-Wes-Bos-

In this repository you will find the finished JS apps made during the #Javascript30. It's a 30 days online challenge (https://javascript30.com/) made by Wes Bos that consists in building a Javascript "thing" per day.

To give a bit of context and help my fellow beginners. I started learning Node.js few months ago and I plan to get some knowledge in front JS frameworks (VueJs, React). So this class is a sort of introduction to put my hands into vanilla JS before starting to use frameworks. What I want is to better understand how frameworks work (bit of poetry never hurts) and why they are useful.
That's why in every session you'll find some short and personal comments on stuff I find interesting and I want to remember :).

Started June the 5th 2017, let's see what we'll have by the end of it!
